# World-Cup-Data-Visualization

In this project, data from Kaggle for the FIFA World Cup is used to visualize
the data for the average number of goals scored during the 40 years the
World Cup has ran.

The first visualization uses a bar chart and the matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn libraries
to create an appealing data visualization that calculates the average number of goals 
that ocurred during games in a given year.  Notice that the CSV file titled 'WorldCupMatches.csv',
once placed in a dataframe, only has columns for the home team goals and the away team goals.  In
order to get the total number of goals, it was necessary to aggregate the two columns together using
the pandas library to create a new column titled 'Total Goals.'

The second chart is a boxplot that assists in viewing the distribution of data for each given year.
